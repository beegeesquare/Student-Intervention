In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "**Answer: ** In students intervention project, under given performances so far for the student, the goal is to predict whether the student is going to graduate or not (fail). Outcome of this machine learning algorithm is trying to predict PASS or FAIL. This is esentinally nothing but taking the input and mapping to the labels. In this case the labels are PASS or FAIL. This type of supervised learning problem is classification. In classification problems, we want to predict output values that can take small number of discrete values. In the student intervention project, output takes only PASS (1) and FAIL (0), and this can be called also as binary classification problem. "

    "**Answer: ** The three supervised learning models that could be appropriate for this problem are (1) Decision trees (2) Support Vector Machines  and (3) Navie Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Decision tree (DT) belong to class of supervised learning algorithms. Decision tree learns from the data by creating simple rules and predicts the traget (class for this problem). As the name implies decision tree creates a tree like learning model and at every stage (or node) in tree it asks a certain question and the next stage could be either on the left or right branch of the node depending on whether the rule is stasfied or not. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are wide varitey of applications for DTs. It is largely used in data-mining (process of extracting information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use) for categorization of the data. DTs can be applied both for classification and regresstion analysis problems. Finanical firms applies DTs to assist the customers on buy-writes. DTs also find there applications in object recogination, where the tree based classifiers are used to predict a 3D object. DTs are also used in medical industry, to classify the type of tumor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Stengths: Simple to understand and the tree structure can be visualized. Visualization of the tree helps to understand how the tree evolved and what features were considered in predicting the target. Decision tree can also be used for multi-class problems. It can work with numerical and categorical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: DTs more often may not be generalizing the data. This results in over-fitting the data. DTs are based of heuristic algorithms (mostly greedy) where local decisions are made at each node anId they might always not result in global optimum solution. Decision tree's could be large especially for XOR or odd parity. These DTs will grow exponetially. For example fpr n-bit XOR it is the order of 2<sup>n</sup>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the current data-set (which is classification problem), the reason to choose DT as the possible candidate for this problem is, it is simple. As pointed out in the weakness section, though it could not be generalizing the data very well, chossing this model as the first-cut could give a better understanding of performance of feature selection. Also this is computationally faster and easy to explain. From the decision-tree graph schematic (shown in later section) we can understand the influence of each feature in making the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Support Vector Machines (SVMs): SVM learning algorithms are amoung the best supervised learning algorithms. SVMs are based on the intution of finding the best margin, i.e., seperating the data with large gap.  SVM's are appropriate for this problem, as this learning algorithm can create a decision boundary using that we will be able to predict the likelihood that a given student will pass or fail, depending of which side of the decision boundary the predicted value falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs have been sucessfully applied in many real-world problems such as (1) text categorization (2) image classification (3) cancer predition (4) hand-written characeter recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: They work really well for high dimensional spaces with clear margin of seperation. The are versitle, i.e., different Kernel functions can be specified, such as Guassian Kernel\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: They don't perform very well with large data sets, can be computationally costly. Training time is order of cubic and with large data sets, it can be slow. If there is lot of overlapping classes, SVM might not be a right choice. Unlike logistic regression, SVM does not provide probability estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data set, it is clear that there are lot of features that could help in making an prediction and SVM is a right choice for such problems. Also the given data-set is small about (~400), which makes SVM a right choice. Also with the help of Kernels, attributes (features) are mapped to new quantities and SVM can be applied on this new mapped features. In this way SVM can be trained to learn on high dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Navie Bayes: This is a class of supervisied learning algorithms, and it belongs to generative learning algorithms. Unlike logistic regression or perceptron (netural network) algorithms, where the algorithms try to learn mappings directly from the space of inputs, Navie Bayes models the distribution of p(x/y). Given the data/problem, where the features would be normally distributed p(x<sub>i</sub>/y), Guassian Navie Bayes algorithm can be used for classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of Navie Bayes are in Natural language Processing (NLP). Google uses lot of Navie Bayes, especially given a large data-set. It is also widely used in spam classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strengths: Using Navie Bayes, makes the inference cheap. Due to conditional independence, the number of attributes is linear. Estimating the parameters (probability) is easier. It is widely used, especially if you have large data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weakness: Navie Bayes works on very strong assumption. It assumes that feature vectors (x<sub>i</sub>) are conditionally independent given y. Conditional independence assumption might be rarely true in real-world applications. It does not model interrelationships between the attributes. Though this is really, not a weakness of Navie Bayes, as the interrelationships might cancel out. But the biggest disadvantage of Navie Bayes is amount of data available. It is always not possible to have large amount of data, for instance for a particular attribute/feature x<sub>j</sub> there is not output value. Note that the conditional probability are just counting. So, that means p(x<sub>j</sub>/y)=0 making the entire product zero. This might give misleading affect on classification as the other attributes might have strong probailities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rational for chosing Navie-Bayes for this problem is computationally faster. Though we don't have large data, for which Navie-Bayes may not be a right choice, it would be interesting to see how this algorithm would perform with other two. By comparing these three we can make an assertion about picking the right choice."

    "**Answer: ** Based on the three classifies experimented with, I think Support Vector Machine classification gives better results. Given data is for 395 students, which is kind of limited in some sense. As the data is small we choose SVM here which is computationally efficient (predicts the classification) quickly. F<sub>1</sub> scores for SVM are higher for both test and training sets for various amounts of data. Although F<sub>1</sub> for DT on training set is 1 (which is ideal), it performs poorly on the test test, i.e, it might be overfitting. Guassian Navie Bayes performs better than DT on test test, but due to limited availablity of data, it might be missing out some attributes.\n",

    "**Answer: ** We choose SVM for this problem, which basically works on the idea of seperating the data (PASS/FAIL) with large gap. These algorithms maximizes the amount of confidence with which our predictions are right. Say we have seperated the data (drawing a boundary between two classes of outputs). If a data point is far from this boundary and are asked to make a prediction about the output, then with high confidence we can say that it should either PASS/FAIL.\n",
    "Support Vector Machine tries to maximize this confidence by creating a boundary seperating these classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In SVM based algorithms we draw a hyperplane (or a line for simplicity) such that a value of the hyperplane decides if we are in positive or negative class. SVM takes the data points and creates a mapping such that the output values are either +ve or -ve, and depending on the value one can predict which side of the class a particular value belongs to. SVM creates these decision boundary (or hyperplane) such that it is far away from the data as possible, while also maximizing the classification of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Figure shown below explains some first principles of SVM algorithms. Here we have plotted the data from an example dataset. Clearly we can seperate the data that belongs to two classes (+ve/-ve or 1/0 or YES/NO). But now the question is where that boundary line should be drawn? Consider a data point A, which is far from the upper right dotted line. If we were asked to make the prediction of A we can confidently say that it on +ve class (or -ve class). However if we make the prediction for a red circled data point we see that any small change in the dotted line could cause our prediction to change. Thus we can think that given the training set, if we can get a decision boundary that allows us to make all correct and confident prediction, we are done. This brings us the notion of margins.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the discussion above we see that we require a large \"gap\" (margin) between the data point and the boundary. In other words we try to find a decision boundary that maximizes the margin, since it would reflect a very confident set of predictions on the training set and good fit to the training data. This will result in a classifier that seperates the positive and negative with a gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the figure below, a maximum margin seperating hyperplane is shown in the solid line (decision boundary). The points with the smallest margins are points closest to the decision boundary; here these are circled and there are three such points. These three points are called support vectors for this data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The greatest advantage of SVM is its ability to make the non-seperable data into a seperable data by mapping the input attributes to higher dimensions. When we use such larger input space by creating mapping to input attributes, it seperates the data using non-linear seperation. These mapping functions are called Kernels. These Kernels could be linear, polynomial, Guassian, etc. Kernels allow us to implicitly work in a higher-dimensional space, without ever explicitly computing new feature vectors. "
